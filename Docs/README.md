## Features 🚀

- **Hardware Abstraction** 🛠️: Separates board-level and device logic, enabling applications on various development boards (e.g., RoboMaster C, Damo MC-Board01) without modifying application code.
- **Simplified Device Interface** 🖥️: Encapsulates low-level MCU peripherals, providing unified APIs to shield users from complex interrupt handling.
- **Real-Time Control** ⏱️: Supports 1ms periodic interrupts for precise motion control and sensor data processing.
- **Modular Design** 🧩: Manages peripheral-device-component dependencies via `ProjectConfig`, allowing flexible enabling/disabling of components.
- **Modern and Efficient Toolchain** 🔧: Organized with CMake and compiled using Keil’s ArmClang for a balance of modern development and high-efficiency workflows.

## Project Organization 🧠

The Finemote framework adopts a layered architecture, encapsulating functionality from chip-level peripherals to user-friendly application interfaces. This design simplifies development by abstracting hardware complexities. To use Finemote, start with the `Interface` folder:

### Interface Folder

- **InstanceManager** 📋: Manages all instantiated objects in the project. It stores parameters for object construction, handles simple object instantiation, and invokes builders for complex objects.
  - **Instantiation Rule**: Object declarations (using `extern`) are in the `InstanceManager` header, while definitions are in the source file. Since `Interface` includes the `InstanceManager` header, all instantiated objects are accessible in `Interface`.
  - **Construction Order**: Follows a "parts before whole" principle, ensuring dependencies are built before dependent objects.
- **Interface** 🖱️: Provides user-friendly APIs with `Setup` and `Loop` functions, mimicking Python-style programming. Advanced users can leverage 1ms timer interrupt callbacks for precise control.
- **ProjectConfig** ⚙️: Manages dependencies between peripherals, devices, and components. Refer to the documentation for details.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- **Software**: STM32CubeMX, Keil uVision 5 or CMake 3.20+, OpenOCD
- **Hardware**: STM32-based development board (e.g., RoboMaster C, Damo MC-Board01)

### Build Process

Finemote supports two build systems: **MDK-ARM** and **CMake**, differing only in BSP package selection.

- **MDK-ARM** 🛠️:
  1. Select a BSP package and open its Keil project file to start the project.
- **CMake** 📦:
  1. All BSP packages are included as submodules with predefined build targets.
  2. Choose the desired build target to compile.

### Execution Flow

The program starts from an assembly file (named with a `startup` prefix), which calls `SystemInit` and then `__main` (provided by the standard library). The `__main` function handles pre-execution tasks, including invoking constructors for global variables.

> **Note**: Finemote centralizes initialization in constructors. A `HALInit` singleton class (defined in the BSP package’s header) ensures HAL library initialization occurs before other constructors. This class enables interrupts (e.g., timer interrupts) and is accessed by HAL-dependent classes to guarantee proper initialization.

1. `HALInit` constructor initializes the HAL library and enables interrupts ✅.
2. Global variable constructors are executed.
3. The `main` function runs `Setup`, followed by an infinite `Loop` 🔄.
4. During timer interrupts, device `Handle` functions are executed in reverse registration order.

Build completed! 🚀
